        <h3>Jenny John</h3>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Jenny  and I am a responsible and experienced babysitter seeking jobs. Since I have two siblings and lots of cousins; caring for children is something that comes naturally to me. I also started working with children at the age of 12 as a music teacher assistant, then as a camp leader, as a volunteer at charity events and as a babysitter </p>
